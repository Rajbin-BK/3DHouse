3D Virtual House Project

This project utilizes Three.js to create a 3D virtual house environment where users can explore different rooms and interact with objects.

Features
Navigation: Use arrow keys to move the sphere (1st person view) around the house.
Lighting: Dynamic lighting effects with spotlights and ambient lighting to enhance realism.
Day-Night Cycle: Transition between different sky textures (day, sunset, night) using 'Z', 'X', 'C' keys.
Interactive Objects: Various 3D models like furniture, doors, windows, and decorations are placed around the house.


Libraries Used
•	Three.js: A JavaScript 3D library used for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.

•	GLTFLoader: Loader for loading 3D models in GLTF format.

•	OrbitControls: For controlling the camera's position around the scene.

•	Water: A custom shader for simulating water surfaces.





Setup Instructions

  Clone Repository:
  Clone this repository to your local machine using:

  Browser Compatibility: Make sure your browser supports WebGL for Three.js to work properly.


How to Use

•	Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move around the house.

•	Press 'Z' for day mode, 'X' for sunset mode, and 'C' for night mode.

•	Explore different rooms and interact with objects by moving closer to them.
